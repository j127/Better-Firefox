Settings to improve Firefox.

Background
----------

This is my take on settings that help make Firefox better. See [dfkt/firefox-tweaks](https://github.com/dfkt/firefox-tweaks) and [pyllyukko/user.js](https://github.com/pyllyukko/user.js) for similar projects.

Installation
------------

To enable these settings, copy the `user.js` file into your Firefox Profile and restart Firefox. Learn more about [Firefox Profiles](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_folder) and the [user.js file](http://kb.mozillazine.org/User.js_file). Research each preference, and comment out ones that you don't want to change.

On GNU/Linux, your Firefox Profile will be in a location something like: `~/.mozilla/firefox/zxcvbnm.default`.

Alternatively, you can individually modify these settings by typing `about:config` into your address bar, but the method of putting your preferences in `user.js` will make them easier to manage.
